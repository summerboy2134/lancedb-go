# LanceDB Go Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating various LanceDB capabilities using the Go SDK. Each example is a complete, runnable program that showcases different aspects of working with LanceDB.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The easiest way to run examples is using the provided Makefile:

```bash
# Download native libraries and run all examples
make

# Or run individual examples
make basic-crud
make vector-search
make hybrid-search
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running examples, you need to set up native libraries:

### Option 1: Using Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
# Download libraries automatically
make download-artifacts
```

### Option 2: Manual Download
```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lancedb/lancedb-go/main/scripts/download-artifacts.sh
chmod +x download-artifacts.sh

# Run it
./download-artifacts.sh
```

### Option 3: Check Your Setup
```bash
# See platform detection and CGO configuration
make platform-info
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Building Examples

```bash
# Build all examples
make build-all

# Build without running
make build-all

# Test builds (quick verification)
make test
```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run all examples sequentially
make run-all

# Run specific example
make basic-crud
make vector-search
# ... etc
```

### Platform Information

```bash
# Check your platform and CGO configuration
make platform-info
```

Example output:
```
Platform Detection Information:
================================
Operating System: Darwin
Architecture:     arm64
Normalized Platform: darwin
Normalized Arch:     arm64
Platform-Arch:       darwin_arm64
Current Directory:   /path/to/examples

CGO Configuration:
==================
CGO_CFLAGS:  -I/path/to/examples/include
CGO_LDFLAGS: /path/to/examples/lib/darwin_arm64/liblancedb_go.a -framework Security -framework CoreFoundation -framework SystemConfiguration

Library Status:
===============
✅ Library directory exists: /path/to/examples/lib/darwin_arm64/
```

### Cleaning Up

```bash
# Clean built binaries and temp files
make clean

# Clean everything including downloaded libraries
make clean-all
```

## 🔧 Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer to set up CGO manually:

```bash
# 1. Download artifacts (if not done already)
make download-artifacts

# 2. Get platform-specific CGO flags
make platform-info

# 3. Set environment variables
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I$(pwd)/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="$(pwd)/lib/darwin_arm64/liblancedb_go.a -framework Security -framework CoreFoundation -framework SystemConfiguration"

# 4. Build and run manually
cd basic_crud
go run basic_crud.go
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Native libraries not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Download the libraries
make download-artifacts
```

**2. "Header files not found"**
```bash
# Check if include directory exists
ls -la include/

# Re-download if missing
make download-artifacts
```

**3. "CGO compilation failed"**
```bash
# Check your platform configuration
make platform-info

# Ensure CGO environment variables are set correctly
echo $CGO_CFLAGS
echo $CGO_LDFLAGS
```

**4. "Build failed on different platform"**
- The Makefile automatically detects your platform
- Supported: macOS (amd64/arm64), Linux (amd64/arm64), Windows (amd64)
- Run `make platform-info` to verify detection

### Getting Help

1. **Check platform info**: `make platform-info`
2. **Verify library setup**: `ls -la lib/*/`
3. **Test basic build**: `make test`
4. **Clean and retry**: `make clean-all && make`
